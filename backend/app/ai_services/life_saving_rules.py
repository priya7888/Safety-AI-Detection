IOGP Life-Saving Rules Mapping Engine
------------------------------------
Maps free-text safety report evidence deterministically against the 9 standard
IOGP Life-Saving Rules (LSR):
1. Energy Isolation (LSR-01)
2. Work at Height (LSR-02)
3. Safe Mechanical Lifting (LSR-03)
4. Line of Fire (LSR-04)
5. Confined Space Entry (LSR-05)
6. Bypassing Safety Controls (LSR-06)
7. Hot Work & Fire Prevention (LSR-07)
8. Driving & Mobile Equipment (LSR-08)
9. Work Authorization / PTW (LSR-09)

Supports:
- Single primary rule mapping
- Multi-rule support when multiple rules are genuinely triggered
- Strict rule: Never forces a rule when evidence is insufficient
- Energy Vector is kept conceptually distinct from IOGP Rules.
